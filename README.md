MLS Table
=========

MLS Table is a simple node.js app built on [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express).

Right now, it's basically just a scraper for the [MLS Soccer results page](http://www.mlssoccer.com/results), and the only real function it provides is a week-by-week table of cumulative points in MLS.
